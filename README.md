##Quick Start Guide
**void append(const QJsonValue &value);**
Inserts value at the end of the array.

**QJsonValue at(int i) const;**
Returns a QJsonValue representing the value for index i.

**QJsonParseError error() const;**
Returns the last error.

**void flush();**
If there's data need to write to disk, will write all the data to the disk.

**virtual void load();**
When all the data has been read from the disk, KNLibDatabase will call this function to process data.

**void replace(int i, const QJsonValue &value);**
Replaces the item at index position i with value. i must be a valid index position in the array (i.e., 0 <= i < size()).

**QJsonObject row(int i) const;**
Returns a QJsonObject representing the value for index i. The QJsonObject will covert from the QJsonValue at index i.

**void setBatchCount(int batch);**
Set after how many instructions the database should write the cache to the disk.
When you call this function, KNLibDatabase will call the flush() function to write all the current data into the disk.

**void setDatabase(const QString &filePath);**
Set the database file.

**void removeAt(int i);**

**int size() const;**
Returns the number of values stored in the array.

**QJsonValue takeAt(int i);**
Removes the item at index position i and returns it. i must be a valid index position in the array (i.e., 0 <= i < size()).
